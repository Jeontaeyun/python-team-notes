# üëãüèª Introduction

This repository is Python Coding Test Team Notes. It's going to be my own algorithm study notes.  
What we've been seen in algorithm test are mainly next type of problem:

- Greedy
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph, Tree
- BFS(Breath First Search), DFS(Depth First Search)
- Implementation
- Binary Search, Search
- Sort(Selection, Bubble, Quick, Insertion, Shell, Merge, Heap, Radix)
- Shortest Path(Kruskal Algorithm), MST(Minimum Spanning Tree), Topology Sort

This repository is going to describe about above problem and solution using `python` language.

# üí° Overall Description

### Algorithm Design Paradigm

To make good algorithm, we have [several methodology](http://www.aistudy.co.kr/algorithm/design_park.htm) like:

- Divide and Conquer
- Balance Algorithm
- Recursion Algorithm
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithm
- Backtracking
- Approximation Algorithm

And I need to learn about complexity theory afterward(like P problem, NP problem).
