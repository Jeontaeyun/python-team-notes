# üëãüèª Introduction

This repository is Python Coding Test Team Notes. It is my algorithm study notes.  
What we can see in algorithm test are mainly next type of problem:

- Greedy
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph, Tree
- BFS(Breath First Search), DFS(Depth First Search)
- Implementation
- Binary Search, Search
- Sort(Selection, Bubble, Quick, Insertion, Shell, Merge, Heap, Radix)
- Shortest Path(Kruskal Algorithm), MST(Minimum Spanning Tree), Topology Sort

This repository is going to describe about above problem and solution using `python` language.
